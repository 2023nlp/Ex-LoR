    "question": "Which of the following, if true, best supports the researchers' inference?",
    "A": "Researchers have found that people who are inactive due to disability or other factors are more likely to develop osteoporosis and muscle loss than those who are physically active and may benefit from drinking wine.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Resveratrol can prevent osteoporosis and muscle atrophy“ explains that “Astronauts on the International Space Station or spacecraft for a long time may be able to take resveratrol supplement“. In order to strengthen the argument, it is necessary to establish the connection between the premise and the conclusion, that is, to establish the correlation between “osteoporosis and muscle atrophy“ and “astronauts on the space station“. The comparison showed that mice given resveratrol daily in simulated weightlessness showed no loss of bone and muscle density, while mice given no resveratrol showed no loss of bone and muscle density. “This suggests that resveratrol may play an important role in preventing bone loss and muscle atrophy during weightlessness, establishing a link between osteoporosis prevention and space Station astronauts.",

To be sure, such risks do exist. But how can we imagine doing anything without all risks? Let me ask you a question. Why don't we limit the legal speed of cars to no faster than that of bicycles, and the rate of automobile fatalities could be reduced to almost zero?

    "context": "Experts believe the reason for the dramatic decline in tiger numbers is simple: the illegal killing of wild animals has not been completely banned, and the fur trade is still rampant in many countries in East Asia. Experts say new population growth trends and economic changes in Asia are having a significant impact on tiger survival. Asia's wealthy middle class can afford expensive “tiger feasts“ - dinners of tiger body parts to show off their wealth. This has also fuelled the illegal trade in wild tigers, which has contributed to the dramatic decline of tiger populations in Asia.",

At first, the rocco was a new kind of decoration, for the refined, intelligent society that loved adventure, the exotic, the fancy, and nature.

Who's going to pay for the advertisements that seem to be driving down prices in newspapers and magazines?

Many merchants took advantage and melted coins to take copper, which resulted in a serious shortage of coins in the market, and barter appeared in many places. However, the taxes imposed by the imperial court on the citizens must be paid in coins, not in real goods or silver. The citizens could only buy and exchange coins from the officials with silver to pay taxes, and many officials made a lot of money out of it. Such a situation had never happened in the Ming and Qing dynasties before Yongzheng.",

    "A": "Only I. ⅰ. The copper contained in the coin is worth more than the face value of the coin.",

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "(1) Ⅰ can be derived from the explanation of the problem stem. Because, if in fact the value of copper contained in the above coin is not higher than the face value of the coin, then it will be unprofitable for melting coins to take copper, and there will be no merchants melting coins to take copper as mentioned in the question stem, resulting in a serious shortage of coins in the market. (2) Ⅱ can be introduced from the statement of the problem stem. Because, if the above transactions of silver purchase and coinage could be completed in strict accordance with the ratio of prices stipulated by the imperial court, there would be no officials making a big deal through the above transactions, and the related phenomena stated in the question would not appear. (3) Ⅲ can not be derived from the statement of the topic stem. The copper content of the coinage is more than 60%, which may lead to the merchant melting coins to take copper, but does not necessarily lead to the merchant melting coins to take copper, for example, if there is a strict Wang law. Therefore, it can not be concluded that the copper content of the coins is below 60% by not seeing the phenomenon stated in the problem stem of the Ming and Qing dynasties before Yongzheng",

Argument: Theoretically, if nothing else, “large body size“ and “long life span“ are the two most plausible answers for why animals are susceptible to cancer. The argument: “Large body size“ means more cells make up the body, while “long life“ means more new cells are needed to replace them. The more cells there are, the higher the chance of random mutations in cell division. Large body size and long life span cause animals to be prone to cancer. The reason for the argument is that large body size and long life span cause animals to be prone to cancer.

Scientists have traced the journey of phosphorus-containing molecules from space to Earth by observing star-forming regions. The results show that phosphorus molecules are created when massive stars form. The newly formed stars release air currents that create channels in the interstellar cloud. As the star wobbles and emits radiation, the molecules deposit on the walls of these channels and produce particles of phosphorus monoxide, which then converge and fuse, turning a small rock into a comet. These comets, in turn, became messengers of life, carrying life molecules to Earth.",

Fact Information: Employee A, B and C received all 5 awards; Each employee will receive a maximum of two awards; A gets the star Award, and someone between employee B and employee C gets the writing award. Step 2: Deduce the choices based on the factual information. A can be translated as, B: Writing Award → Dedication award. According to the inverse rule, from ② can be introduced “writing award → - collaboration award“, “collaboration award“ is sure ③ after, Ken can not draw the conclusion of absolute expression, that is, B may get the dedication award, there may be no dedication award, so A is not necessarily correct; B, B won the collaboration award, B and C each won two awards. (2) If B wins the award for collaboration, B cannot win the award for writing. From the inverse rule of ③, we can deduce “cooperation award → dedication award“, that is, if B wins the collaboration award, he cannot win the dedication award. If either of them wins the writing prize, C wins the writing prize. B and C won the award for creativity and dedication, so B and C won the award for creativity and dedication respectively, that is, B and C won two awards each, and B can definitely be introduced. C, if B won the writing award and enterprise award, and from the fact information know A won the star award, then the rest of the collaboration award and dedication award two awards, by ③ we know that the dedication award and cooperation award can not be obtained by the same person, that is, C can not get the dedication award and collaboration award at the same time, and because A has won the star award, can not get the dedication award, so can launch C won the dedication award, A won the award for cooperation. To sum up, if B wins the writing award and the creative award, then C can only get the dedication award, A can get the star award and the collaboration award, C error; D, if C wins the award for collaboration, B does not win the award for collaboration.

With the continuous excavation of painted pottery in Majiayao, Gansu Province, Antersen believed that Gansu painted pottery was significantly influenced by painted pottery in Western Europe and West Asia. However, the date of the painted pottery unearthed in the first phase of Dadi Wan was obviously earlier than that of Majiayao painted pottery, which is roughly equivalent to the date of Yermo pottery culture and Hashana culture in the Two-river Valley of West Asia, which are the earliest painted pottery culture found at present",

Argument: The prevalence of obesity in the West is closely related to brightly lit street scenes at night and the light from computers and television sets. The argument: Three groups of rats were exposed to light for 16 hours during the day and then left in full black, dark, or light on for 8 hours at night, each day. All the rats ate exactly the same food and how much they ate during the experimental period. They found that the mice exposed to dark light at night and the mice exposed to dark light at night also gained weight. The argument in question is that light is also responsible for obesity in the West, based on the results of three groups of mice. The argument is inconsistent with the body of the argument.

A: According to this statement, the experimental rats in dark light and light environment eat at night differently from those in dark environment. The former rats eat at night, and whether they eat at night affects their weight, which shows that the experiment in the argument is unscientific, will affect the experimental results, weaken the argument and retain the argument.

    "D": "The structural similarity between chimpanzee and gorilla brain is greater than that between chimpanzee and monkey brain",
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Step 1: Grasp the object and the key of the explanation. The first paragraph explains that the proportion of different functional regions in the total brain volume is an important characteristic of a species. There may be significant differences in brain volume between individuals of the same species, but the structural characteristics of the brain are basically the same. However, there are great differences in structural characteristics between different species. The researchers speculate that structural features of the brain will help distinguish between species that are related. Step 2: Make the correct choice according to the question stem. According to “Within the same species, individuals may have distinct differences in brain volume, but the structural characteristics of the brain are basically the same; In different species, there are great differences in structural characteristics “, it can be known that the similarity of structural characteristics of the brain of the same species is greater than the similarity of brain characteristics of different species, so the similarity of brain structure of “chimpanzee“ and “gorilla“ of the same species is greater than the similarity of brain structure of “chimpanzee“ and “monkey“ of different species. (A) The differences between human brains, (B) the differences between human brains and monkey brains, (C) the structural similarities between human brains and ape brains are greater than those of monkey brains and lemuri brains. (C) The brain sizes of different individuals of the same species may be significantly different, but the structural characteristics of the brain are basically the same",

    "A": "About a third of the carbon dioxide produced by human combustion of fossil fuels has been absorbed by the Earth's oceans, which gradually acidifies the waters and softens the shells and bones of Marine li",
    "B": "In ocean regions with high carbon dioxide levels, oxygen levels are lower. Less oxygen makes it harder for Marine life to breathe, find food, avoid predators, and reproduce",
    "C": "Carbon dioxide is an important nutrient for many Marine organisms, which under exposure convert the carbon dioxide absorbed by the leaves and the water transported by the landscape into sugars, starches and oxygen",
    "D": "Carbon dioxide is an important nutrient for many Marine organisms, which under exposure convert the carbon dioxide absorbed by the leaves and the water transported by the leaves into sugars, starches and oxygen",
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Explanation “:“ Step 1: Find the argument. The argument: Fish hatched in a high carbon dioxide environment will be less able to survive. The argument: Experiments conducted by researchers. Step 2: Analyze the options one by one. C) Carbon dioxide converts water into sugars, starches and oxygen. A high carbon dioxide environment, far from affecting viability, is actually beneficial. This weakens the argument. (A) Carbon dioxide acidifies seawater and causes the shells and bones of Marine organisms to soften, which suggests that the higher the concentration of carbon dioxide, the more the shells and bones of Marine organisms are softened and the less able they are to defend themselves. B) Ocean areas with high carbon dioxide content have low oxygen content, which increases the difficulty for Marine organisms to breathe, forage and reproduce, and thus reduces the survival ability of Marine organisms. D) Clownfish raised in high carbon dioxide waters were unable to hear the sounds of predators, suggesting that clownfish are vulnerable to predators and are not conducive to survival.",

    "context": "In natural selection, only sexual reproduction can produce random variation, and environmental pressures (such as disease infestation) can fix beneficial mutations (such as the acquisition of disease resistance). But in asexual reproduction, the genetic material of the offspring does not mutate as the number of reproductive algebras increases. Because canna chinensis (a variety of banana) is propagated primarily by cuttings, all canna grown worldwide are clones of the same plant. As a result, if a new strain starts to infect Canna, it is likely to be wiped out in the same way that the Gros Mike variety was wiped out by infection in the mid-19th century",

A poison rat = one one ∨ rat = b ∨ dimethoate. Therefore, item Ⅰ “ethyla dimethoate“ can be true or false. Relation of “and“ with “or“ ① we know that “AAB“ is true, we can derive “A true AB true“, so “A∨B“ must be true. ② Given that “A∨B“ is true, there are three possibilities “A true AB true“, “A true AB false“, “A false AB true“, and when the first possibility occurs, “AAB“ is true; “AAB“ is false when the latter two possibilities occur. Thus, if “A∨B“ is known to be true, then “AAB“ is not true or false. This item can also be solved by permutation and combination thinking: human has 2 possibilities A and B, and drug has 3 possibilities Dimethoate, poison rat, and both, so there are 2×3=6 possibilities, and if you confirm any one possibility, you can exclude the other 5 possibilities; But only by denying 5 possibilities, can we confirm the other 1 possibility. (2) Two poisons may have been used at the same time. (2) It can't be Dimethoate. (2) It can't be Dimethoate. ⅲ. 7a → B; 7. Tetramethylenium → Dimethoate; 7 methylA7 poison rat strong; So, ethyl dimethoate. Therefore, item Ⅲ is true.",

In a purely analog system, a signal can be refined infinitely whereas a digital system cannot possibly produce a signal more precise than its digital units can express. However, this theoretical advantage also brings with it practical disadvantages. In an analog system, each refinement of the initial signal changes the initial signal very slightly.

Hair follicle stem cells are cells that live in hair follicles for a long time, producing hair for us throughout our lives. Hair follicle stem cells take up glucose from the blood, which is metabolized into pyruvate. Some of this pyruvate is transported by the cell to the mitochondria, where the progressive metabolism of pyruvate provides the cell with energy. The other part of the pyruvate goes through subsequent changes inside the cell to produce a new metabolite, lactic acid, which activates hair follicle cells and makes hair grow faster. This has led researchers to believe that drugs that boost lactic acid levels could treat hair loss",

(2) We can see that either Julie and Xue Fang meet the conditions (1) or neither of them meet the conditions (2). Since there are three people who meet the conditions (1), Julie and Xue Fang can only meet the conditions (1). From (1), it can be seen that Cheng Qiang does not meet the conditions ①. In order to be employed, three conditions must be met. If Cheng Qiang does not meet the conditions, it can be concluded that Cheng Qiang is impossible to be employed. The third step: combine the other information of the question stem to continue the derivation. Since there is only one qualified person (3), it cannot be the excluded Qiang Cheng, and since everyone meets at least one condition, Qiang Cheng must meet condition (2). It can be seen from (3) that either Li Ping and Xue Fang met the conditions (2) or neither met them.

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The bottom 5% get a pay rise, the top 5% get a pay cut. Xiao Wang's salary is higher than the average, while Xiao Li's is lower than the average. The amount of the average wage is greatly affected by the extreme value, so getting the average wage is not necessarily in the 50% position. If 95% or more of the population earns only slightly above average, and 5% or less earn far below average, above-average wages are still likely to be in the bottom 5%. Therefore, the rank of salary of Xiao Wang and Xiao Li cannot be determined. Both of them may rank in the top 5% or the bottom 5%, or they may not be in the top 5%. Therefore, it is impossible to judge whether the salary of Xiao Li and Xiao Wang will be increased or decreased. I: If both Xiao Wang and Xiao Li are in the bottom 5%, then both of them have had their salaries raised. I may be true. Ⅱ : If both Wang and Li are in the top 5%, then both of them have reduced their wages, Ⅱ may be true. Ⅲ : It is known that Xiao Wang's salary is higher than the average wage and Xiao Li's is lower than the average wage, so Xiao Wang's salary must be higher than Xiao Li's. Therefore, it is impossible that Xiao Wang's salary is in the bottom 5% and Xiao Li's is in the top 5%. Therefore, it is impossible that Xiao Wang's salary is increased while Xiao Li's salary is decreased. Therefore, Ⅲ must be false. Ⅳ : Xiao Wang's salary must be higher than Xiao Li's. If Xiao Wang's salary is in the top 5% and Xiao Li's salary is in the bottom 5%, then Xiao Wang reduces his salary and Xiao Li raises his salary, Ⅳ may be true",

    "explanation": "explanation: The hospital where Zhang Yong's father was born has no obstetric record in 1934, but there is a record in 1935. However, the hospital has no birth record of Zhang Yong's father, leading to the conclusion that Zhang Yong's father was born in 1934. It is necessary to assume the check item I, but even with the check item I, the conclusion of 1934 cannot be drawn. Because both Zhang and his sister may have remembered it wrong, check Ⅱ is required. Check number three says the father must remember his birth year. It is not an assumption.",

    "context": "By analyzing the light emitted or absorbed by the atoms of the object, it can measure whether the object is moving away from the Earth or approaching the Earth. When the object is moving away from the Earth, the frequency of the light will shift to the red end of the spectrum (low frequency), which is referred to as“ red shift “, and vice versa, it is called “blue shift“. The unique light emitted by atoms is also affected by the mass of the elementary particles, especially electrons, that make them up. As the mass of an atom increases, the energy of the photons emitted becomes higher, so the frequencies of light emitted and absorbed will shift blue. Conversely, if the particles become lighter and lighter, the frequency will be redshifted. Astronomical observations show that most galaxies have a redshift, and that the redshift increases the farther a galaxy is from Earth, leading many scientists to believe that the universe must be expanding",

Step 2: Parse the process. According to (2), (5) and (6), Ding is not a player from the School of Chemistry, nor is Ding a player from the School of Management, School of Philosophy or School of Mathematics, so Ding is a player from the School of Economics. According to (3) and (5), B is not a player from the School of Management, B is not a player from the School of Philosophy or Mathematics, and because D is a player from the School of Economics, B is a player from the School of Chemistry. Combined with (2) and (3), it can be seen that B, as a player from the School of Chemistry, has 3 matches. Since B has not played against any player from the School of Management, he must have played against D, D and D respectively to meet the requirement of three times. B has played against only one player. B has also played against players from the School of Philosophy and the School of Mathematics. In combination with (5), players from the School of Philosophy and the School of Mathematics have not only played against players from the School of Management, the School of Philosophy and the School of Mathematics, but also against players from the School of Chemistry (B). Therefore, the number of games played by players from the School of Philosophy and the School of Mathematics is not less than 3. It can also be seen from (1) that A ≠ a player from the School of Mathematics, and A ≠ a player from the School of Philosophy. Therefore, A = player from School of Management.

    "explanation": "① Wei Ying Luo: Wei Ying Luo broken; ② Er Qing: It was not broken by Er Qing; ③ Gao Guifei: It was not Wei Liluo who broke it; ④ Chunfei: Erqing did not break it. True or false: The person who broke the crystal cup told a false story, while the others were not sure whether it was true or false. Assuming that it was Wei Zan-Luo who broke the crystal cup, she would only say that I did not break it, rather than that I broke it, which would be contradictory at this time.

Then the person who broke the crystal cup can only be one or both of Erqing and Chunfei. Further, if it is not Erqing who breaks the crystal cup, then ② Erqing and ④ Chunfei are both telling the truth. The fact that no one broke the crystal cup is inconsistent with the fact that at least one person broke the crystal cup.

Bad conclusion: During the last hunting season, people were safer in the woods than walking on sidewalks. Comparing “safer“ involves the percentage of injuries -- the probability of unsafe incidents rather than just the number of injuries -- so you also need to know the total number of people walking in the woods versus on the sidewalk to derive the probability of accidents for comparison. Choice A, the ratio of pedestrians on the road to the number of people in the woods during the last hunting season, gives a base for the total number of people so that an evaluation can be made.",

If the copper content of the coinage is more than 60%, it may lead to the merchants to melt coins and take copper, but it does not necessarily lead to the merchants to melt coins and take copper in succession, for example, if there is a strict royal law. Therefore, it can't be concluded that the copper content of coinage is below 60% from the phenomenon that the Ming and Qing dynasties before Yongzheng had not seen the problem",

With the continuous excavation of painted pottery in Majiayao, Gansu Province, Antersen believed that Gansu painted pottery was significantly influenced by painted pottery in Western Europe and West Asia. However, the date of the painted pottery unearthed in the first phase of Dadi Wan was obviously earlier than that of Majiayao painted pottery, which is roughly equivalent to the date of Yermo pottery culture and Hashana culture in the Two-river Valley of West Asia, which are the earliest painted pottery culture found at present",

The argument is that an unnamed player told reporters that he and his teammates took a $200,000 bribe to fix a crucial match in favor of the other team. Step 2: Determine the nerf. The argument emphasizes 30 years of competition, and the argument emphasizes a competition. Therefore, there is no obvious causal relationship between the argument and the argument. The argument should be weakened, and no bridge between the argument and the argument. Step 3: Judge the effect of each option. A. The magazine has published false reports several times, but it does not prove that the reports are also false. A. The magazine has published false reports several times. B: the punishment is very heavy, usually there will be no match-fixing events, can be supported to a certain extent, but the intensity is weak; C) The match-fixing incident in that match was true, and it cannot be concluded that the First Division championship in 30 years was decided through match-fixing, which means that there is no bridge between 30 years of matches and one match. D) Just because a national investigation didn't find it, doesn't mean it didn't, so support is weak.",

Second, look for arguments and evidence. Argument: The disease progression of ALS is closely related to the number of AM bacteria in the gut microbe. The argument: People with ALS have decreased levels of niacinamide in their blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Step 3: Identify the options. Item A: Unclear item. The microbes in the gut are complex and do not directly correlate with ALS disease or niacinamide levels. B: Supplementary premise. If the supplementation of niacinamide is a metabolite of intestinal microbe AM bacteria, and the evidence mentions that the level of niacinamide in patients is decreased, it can be concluded that the development of ALS disease is closely related to AM bacteria, which is a necessary condition for the establishment of the argument and belongs to the premise. Item C: Add to the argument. By illustrating the reduction of ALS symptoms in mice supplemented with niacinamide, it is shown that the two are indeed related and have a reinforcing effect. D) They are not associated with the disease. D) Changes in intestinal bacteria are associated with the development of ALS, but not with the development of ALS. The fourth step, strength comparison.

Molecule X has a Y structure, which connects a large number of atoms, and a substance composed of this molecule has strong thermal conductivity among other substances of the same type. The explanation is as follows: Two phenomena of molecules are found: one is that a molecule has a large number of atoms, and the other is that a substance composed of molecules can conduct heat. The conclusion connects these two points and deduces the causal relationship. The strongest way to make a dent is to have something that conducts heat, but doesn't have a lot of atoms.

After the reform of the rural economic system, the life of the residents in the affected areas gradually improved, the nutritional structure tended to be reasonable, and the newly infected people of Keshan disease were less and less, which reached the basic control standard. Step 2: Judge the effect of the options one by one. A, the soil and water quality of Keshan disease affected areas have changed greatly in the past decades, indicating that the reason for the decrease of new Keshan disease patients is not the rational nutrition structure, but the soil and water quality, which is due to the weakening. B, Keshan disease only appears in a few places, not all places with low living standards and nutritional deficiencies have Keshan disease, which weakens the argument. C. Some cases of Keshan disease have also been found in areas with high living standards, indicating that Keshan disease also exists in areas without nutritional deficiencies. D) There is a logical relationship between the adjustment of diet structure and whether Keshan disease can be cured or not. D) There is a logical relationship between dietary structure adjustment and whether Keshan disease can be cured or not",

One of the parents said, “My child replied, 'I'm a boy.'“ The other parent then said, “The child is lying. She is a girl.“ In this family, the men never tell lies, and the women never tell two truths in a row, nor two lies in a row.",

    "D": "Not sure.",
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Step 1: The explanation for the problem is as follows. 1. The first parent: ① My child answers “I am a boy“. The second parent: ② The child lies; ③ She is a girl. 3 In this family, the men never tell lies, but the women never tell two truths in a row or two lies in a row. Step 2: Since the second person must be assumed to be a woman, we can take full advantage of the condition that women do not tell two consecutive truths and do not tell two consecutive lies. So let's assume the first person is the father and the second person is the mother. Step 3: Since the first person is the father, the child's response is indeed “I am a boy.“ At this point, if the child lies, the mother tells the truth two sentences in a row; If the child did not lie, the mother continuously told two false sentences, and the problem stem contradiction. So the first person is the mother and the second person is the father. Step 4: Since men don't lie, the child is indeed a girl. Check 1 only. To sum up, A is correct",

After 12 days, 94% of the seeds in rooms without Wi-Fi transmitters had germination rates. Seeds in rooms with Wi-Fi transmitters had a germination rate of 83 percent. Many people are concerned about the effects of Wi-Fi emission on human health. But experts say the study is not rigorous enough to conclude that Wi-Fi radiation is harmful to humans",
    "question": "Which of the following assertions support the views of these experts, except one?",
    "A": "The effect of Wi-Fi radiation on the human body is frequency dependent and also the distance of the Wi-Fi transmitter from the human body.",

    "C": "There are many factors that affect seed germination, and the Danish high school students' experiment could not rule out other factors.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Expert's point of view: The experiment (the difference between whether there is Wi-Fi in the premise leads to the difference in germination rate of water-lily seeds, indicating that Wi-Fi affects the germination rate of water-lily seeds) is not rigorous, and it cannot be confirmed that Wi-Fi radiation is harmful to human body. No matter how many times the experiment is repeated, it is difficult to explain the influence of Wi-Fi on plants. After all, is Wi-Fi the only correct factor affecting plants? Choice B cannot explain whether the experiment is rigorous or not, so it cannot be supported.",

Argument: The number of undergraduates found to have violated academic norms in their graduation papers has increased significantly in the past 10 years. The second step: determine the way of weakening. The argument emphasizes the academic moral quality of contemporary college students, and the argument emphasizes the number of people who have violated academic norms in the past 10 years. Therefore, there is no obvious causal relationship between the argument and the argument, so the argument should be weakened, and no bridge should be built between the argument and the argument. Step 3: Judge the effect of each option. A: The Internet facilitates academic misconduct. The increasing number of people explaining violations of academic norms strengthens the argument to some extent. B: Colleges and universities fail to educate college students about academic ethics, which also explains the increase in the number of people who violate academic norms, which strengthens the argument to some extent. C) College students' academic ethics In recent 10 years, the number of college graduates has increased significantly, indicating that the overall number of graduates is larger, and the corresponding people who violate the academic norms are more than before. This explains why the number of people who violate the academic norms in the graduation thesis of this university has increased significantly in recent 10 years. Thus, the academic moral quality of contemporary college students and the recent 10 years of violations of academic norms between the number of people do not bridge, is to weaken the argument, is the answer; D: There are 30 college students in the graduation thesis was rated as provincial excellent papers, and the quality of college students in academic ethics is getting worse and worse, is not directly related to the choice",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Step one: Identify the arguments and arguments. Argument: You can raise your body temperature by exercising, drinking hot water, taking a bath, etc., to fight cancer. The argument: Cancer cells fear heat, and a high body temperature can fight cancer. The most vulnerable organs of the human body, including the lungs, stomach, large intestine, breast and so on, are the parts of the body with a low body temperature, and “hot organs“ such as the heart are not susceptible to cancer. In this case, increasing body temperature is the best way to prevent cancer. In this case, increasing body temperature does not prevent cancer. In this case, we should either reject the argument (raising body temperature does not prevent cancer) or reject the argument (high temperature does not prevent cancer in “hot organs“ such as the heart). Step 2: Examine the options one by one. The oral temperature is generally lower than that of the rectal temperature, and the incidence of rectal cancer is higher than that of oral cancer worldwide, indicating that the incidence of rectal cancer is higher due to the high rectal temperature, and raising the body temperature does not prevent cancer. B) There is a precise regulation mechanism of human temperature, and there are no obvious temperature differences among various organs in the body. Therefore, it is impossible to regulate body temperature to fight cancer, which directly reduces the argument. C) Hyperthermia may play a better role, but there are still insufficient research data to prove its reliability. Therefore, it is uncertain whether increasing the temperature is really beneficial to anti-cancer. D) The reason why there are few malignant tumors in the heart is that cardiomyocytes no longer divide and proliferate, regardless of temperature. B directly weakens the argument more strongly than A counterexample and D",

The blue-crowned chickadees seldom eat anything other than the larvae of moths and butterflies, which rules out the possibility of other foods. C. The young born early do not have enough food.

The difference of blood ties between the Han people in the two places is quite large, even greater than the difference between the Han people in the north and the South and the local ethnic minorities. This shows that as the population expanded, the Han people continued to move south, crossing the Yangtze River into Huguang and finally across the Strait to Hainan Island more than 2,000 years ago.

His reasoning is that plate movement must have changed nature's dark mafic rocks into light felsic rocks. And by 3.5 billion years ago, we already had light felsic rocks.",
    "question": "The following, if true, most strongly question the expert's opini",
    "A": "The light-colored felsic rocks are essentially“ regenerated “from the dark-colored mafic rocks that dominated the Earth in absolute numbers billions of years ago",
    "B": "Analysis of 3.5 billion-year-old sediment samples from around the globe shows that less than half of these contain felsic rock particles",
    "C": "The only explanation for the much greater proportion of felsic rocks in nature than mafic rocks seems to be plate tectonics, but early plate tectonics was likely to have been sporadic and localized",
    "D": "Three and a half billion years ago, the Earth was full of volcanoes. The magma released by the eruptions buried the mafic rocks deep underground. The mafic rocks were melted and transformed into alsic rocks, but plate movement was not the only cause of volcanic eruption",
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Step one: Identify the arguments and arguments. Argument: The Earth's plate movements began no later than 3.5 billion years ago. The argument: Plate movement must have changed nature's dark mafic rocks into light felsic rocks, which were already present 3.5 billion years ago. Step 2: Analyze the options one by one. A: It is possible to tell when the Earth's plate movements began by the presence of light felsic rocks. The quantity of ferric and mafic rocks is different, and billions of years of time is not clear enough to reduce or eliminate. B: It is possible to date the beginning of plate movement by the presence of light felsic rocks. It is possible to determine the proportion of particles of felsic rocks in the sedimentary layer. C, “it seems“ and “probably“ mean that it is not certain whether the plate movement caused the transformation of mafic rocks into felsic rocks, or whether the plate movement directly caused the high proportion of felsic rocks, and it does not mention the time, it is not clear, can not be weakened, excluded; D) Volcanic eruptions can transform mafic rocks into felsic rocks, but plate motion is not the only cause of volcanic eruptions. The transformation of mafic rocks into felsic rocks is not necessarily related to plate motion",

While Arctic sea ice has declined dramatically with global warming, Antarctic sea ice is not only not decreasing, it is slowly increasing. Studies have shown that when Antarctic sea ice forms and accumulates early in the growing season, it drifts north away from the coast, driven by winds, creating an ice belt of older and thicker ice that rings Antarctica, something that is not the case in the Arctic. The researchers hypothesized that it was the presence of this ice band that allowed the amount of sea ice to increase",

    "question": "Which of the following would be most helpful in eliminating this inconsistency?",
    "A": "Cities that crack down on drunk driving used to have high traffic accident rates",
    "B": "Cities that crack down on drunk driving have not eliminated it",
    "C": "Raising drivers' awareness of traffic safety is more important than strict management",
    "D": "D: The rate of traffic accidents is different in small cities and big cities",
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The explanation for the explanation is as follows. 1. In fact, the traffic accident rate in cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated is similar to that in cities where it is not; 2. It does reduce the incidence of traffic accidents. Note that the phenomenon in 1 is a horizontal comparison between different cities, while the phenomenon in 2 is a vertical comparison before and after the same city. There is no contradiction between the two phenomena because of the different bases of traffic accident rates in different cities. For example, if you point out that a city with a high incidence of drunk driving has a decrease in its accident rate, it is likely to remain the same as a city with a low incidence of drunk driving",

This topic belongs to the hypothetical comprehensive reasoning question type, because the question is not determined information and ask “which is in line with the proposal“, so we can consider the problem stem information after the series to find contradictory ideas.

Observing the above reasoning chain, it is found that if you go to the Asian Games training base, a set of contradictory concepts of “go to the air force“ and “do not go to the air force“ are introduced at the same time, so you do not go to the Asian Games training base. As the previous step has been determined information, it can be “do not go to the Asian Games training base“ into the remaining conditions for reasoning: do not go to the Asian Games training base → do not go to the science park residential area → go to the Air Force → go to Nanjiang University → do not go to the National Institute of Science",

Young people drive older and less stable cars, suggesting that the more likely cause of traffic deaths among young people may be bad cars, rather than impatient driving. B) To add to the counter-argument. B) The reason why young people are more likely to die in traffic accidents is because there are more passengers. If there is an accident, the probability of death is higher. C) To add to the counter-argument. It is suggested that the higher incidence of traffic fatalities among young people is due to their long driving distances, rather than the debilitating effect of driving in an irritable manner. D) They are more likely to drive. (D) It is clear that accidents are more serious when young people are driving, but it does not address the cause. It does not prove whether young people are driving impatiently",

In addition to the same natural conditions, other conditions including fertilization, pest control, watering and weeding were also the same. One persimmon tree was pruned, while the other one was not pruned. To the harvest season, the yield of a pruned persimmon is more than 30 percent more than that of the unpruned persimmon. Farmers were convinced, and advanced pruning techniques quickly spread",
    "question": "Which of the following is the same as the method used by the professor at Beijing Agricultural University",
    "A": "Half of the students in a class study English and the other half study Japanese. At the end of the semester, the English students did better than the Japanese students, which indicates that the English students in the class are more capable.",

This is because if only a small number of graduates (for example, only one) go to employment counseling, then even if all of them find jobs, it is still a weak basis and it is difficult to establish trust in the advertisement.

In the past three years, the average daily power consumption in Huzhou area increased significantly year by year. This year, the average daily power consumption of any unit exceeding the power standard in Huzhou region is higher than the average daily power consumption of the whole region.",
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "① I can see from the explanation that 20% of the electricity consumption units in Huzhou area exceed the standard, and 80% of the units do not exceed the standard. In the past three years, the number of units exceeding the standard has been increasing year by year in Huzhou area. Therefore, it can be obviously concluded that the number of units below the standard has been decreasing year by year in the past three years. Otherwise, the proportion of units exceeding the standard will exceed 20%, contrary to the definition of units exceeding the standard in the question. So check I must be true. ② Check Ⅱ must not be true. According to the passage, whether a unit exceeds the standard of electricity consumption does not depend on its absolute electricity consumption, but on the relative electricity consumption compared with other units. Therefore, an increase in the number of units exceeding the standard does not necessarily lead to an increase in actual electricity consumption. ③ Check ⅲis not necessarily true. For example, suppose there are 10 electricity units in the area, of which 8 units do not exceed the standard, each consumes 1 unit per day; Of the 2 units that exceed the standard, one consumes 2 units per day and the other consumes 30 units per day. This hypothesis is fully in line with the conditions of the question, but the average daily power consumption of a unit that consumes 2 units per day is not higher than the average daily power consumption of the whole region.",

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "explanation: (1) More than 8 million → excellence award. (2) Incentive award → more than 6 million. (3) Either more than 10 million yuan or less than 6 million yuan. For check I, the branch office of the employee who received the incentive award must have an annual turnover of more than $6 million; And (3) if it exceeds $6 million, it must exceed $8 million; And by (3), employees of branches with an annual turnover of more than 8 million yuan receive an excellence award. Therefore, an employee who receives an incentive award is guaranteed to receive an excellence award. For check Ⅲ, it can be seen from the formula above that no conclusion can be drawn from “receiving an award of excellence“. Therefore, it is entirely possible that an employee receiving an excellence award works for a branch with an annual turnover of less than 6 million yuan and cannot receive an incentive award, so check Ⅱ is not necessarily true. Check Ⅲ is not always true because half the number of branches and half the number of employees are not the same concept -- this confusion is a common pitfall. For check Ⅳ, more than 8 million could not be rolled out to receive incentive awards. For check V, less than 6 million were unable to launch and did not receive an excellence award.",

Out of profit, many merchants melted coins to take copper, resulting in a serious shortage of coins in the market, and the phenomenon of barter appeared in many places. However, when the court levied taxes on citizens, they had to be paid in coins rather than in real objects or silver. Citizens could only buy and exchange coins from officials with silver to pay taxes, and many officials therefore made a great deal of money. This kind of situation never happened in the Ming and Qing dynasties before Yongzheng.",
    "question": "The conclusion can be drawn from the above statement: ① the value of the copper coin contained in the above coin is higher than the face value of the coin ② the above transaction with silver to buy the coin is not in accordance with the proportion stipulated by the imperial court ③ before Yongzheng Ming and Qing dynasties, the copper content of the coin is below 60% ④ during the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty, the coin is the only form of currency",

    "explanation": "Step 1: Grasp the main information of the explanation. The first sentence explains the metal composition of coins made during the Yongzheng Reign of the Qing Dynasty. The second says that merchants melted coins to take copper for profit. The court required citizens to pay the taxes in coins. Citizens bought coins from officials with silver, and officials profited from them. This did not happen in the Ming and Qing dynasties before Yongzheng. Step 2: Analyze the information of the question stem, and combine the options to get the answer. The value of the copper coins contained in the coinage must be higher than the face value of the coinage, so that the merchant can make a profit. (3) Citizens buy and change coins from officials, and the officials benefit from the transaction. It can be inferred that this transaction is not done in normal proportion, otherwise the officials would not be able to make a large sum of money. (2) Correct; In the fourth sentence, the situation that did not occur in the Ming and Qing dynasties refers to the situation that merchants melted coins to take copper and officials benefited from the purchase and exchange of coins. It does not explain how much copper content was in the coins of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Conclusion (3) can not be derived.

    "explanation": "critical thinking evaluation question types. A white-collar worker who has worked regularly for exactly 8 years immediately after graduation from university gains an average of 8kg compared to when he just graduated. As a result, regular work can increase people's weight. (1) Regular work and (2) the 8-year time difference, so it is possible that the weight gain was caused by aging, independent of regular work. In order to evaluate whether this conclusion is correct, we need to rule out the possible effect of time. All other things being equal, people who work regularly and those who work irregularly show the same change in weight. If, like the rest of the group, people who did not work regularly gained weight over the same eight years, then it was not regular work that caused people to gain weight; If they did not gain weight, it could mean that regular work was causing them to gain weight.",

    "context": "Albatrosses belong to the order Shearwaters, having a tubular snout, an acute sense of smell, and often traveling long distances out to sea in search of food. Plastic litter floating around in the sea may not look delicious, but why do albatrosses eat it and pay a heavy price for it? Researchers think it's because it smells “delicious“ to albatrosses. The “food signal“ is a chemical called dimethylthioether (DMS), which is produced by phytoplankton in the ocean",
    "question": "Which of the following, if true, does not support the researcher's claim?",
    "A": "A subset of shearwater birds congregreate in the abundance of phytoplankton in the ocean",
    "B": "Ingestion of plastic waste can cause immobility, obstruction of the digestive tract, and chronic damage to the health of seabirds",

    "D": "Shearwater birds sensitive to the scent of DMS can detect odor molecules at very low concentrations",
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Step one: Identify the arguments and arguments. Argument: Albatrosses eat plastic waste because it smells “good“. The argument: The “gourmet signal“ is dimethylthioether (DMS), an odorous substance produced by phytoplankton in the ocean. In this question, three strengthening options should be eliminated. The argument is that plastic garbage smells “good“. The argument is explaining why it smells “good“. The argument is saying the same thing, so it can be reinforced by additional arguments. Step 2: Analyze the options one by one. A) Some of these birds gather in areas where Marine phytoplankton are abundant, and Marine phytoplankton produce “food signals“ that make birds smell “delicious.“ B) Eating plastic waste can have adverse consequences for seabirds, which is not related to the reason why garbage smells good. C) When plastic waste is soaked in sea water, it produces DMS. C) When albatrosses smell plastic waste, they think it tastes good. D: If shearwater birds can't detect very low concentrations of odorous molecules, they won't eat the waste, which is necessary to strengthen and eliminate the argument.",

The people of Majiacun found through investigation that Zhaojiacun stopped using expensive fertilizer and switched to crop rotation and twice yearly application of manure. Before long, the same measures were adopted in Majiacun, and soon, Majiacun achieved good results",
    "question": "Which of the following is most likely the hypothesis made above?",
    "A": "Majia Village has sufficient sources of manure for field application.",
    "B": "Majiacun often investigates the agricultural production situation of Zhaojiacun and learns the experience of reducing production cost.",
    "C": "Majia Village uses treated sewage ooze instead of fertilizer, but it has little impact on production cost.",
    "D": "Both Zhaojiacun and Majiacun reduced the use of expensive pesticides and reduced production costs",
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "explanation: The method of crop rotation and twice-yearly application of manure (measure → the effect of unit production cost reduction (objective) is obtained. A. It must be assumed that the measures are feasible. Otherwise, if there is no sufficient source of manure, the above measures cannot be implemented, thus overproving the conclusion. A. Crop rotation and twice-yearly manure application B. manure application D) It is not a good idea to use manure",
