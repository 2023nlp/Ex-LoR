(1) Illegal cohabitation refers to cohabitation between members of the opposite sex. Therefore, the number of separated persons living illegally with the separated person is equal to that of men and women. (3) Check number Ⅲ is false. The number of unmarried, divorced, or widowed people living with a separated person is 1 million more than that of men. So check I is true. ③ Persons who are living illegally with a separated person include two parts, one is a separated person and the other is unmarried, divorced or widowed. Two conclusions have been drawn above: first, the number of separated persons living illegally with a separated person is equal to that of men and women; Secondly, there are more men than women among unmarried, divorced or widowed persons living illegally with a separated person.

But in fact, bees don't have to go to such lengths to communicate this information. The scent trail they leave behind as they fly back to the hive from the powder is enough to guide their mates to the powder spot. I don't entirely agree with you. Many animals can perform a certain task in more than one way. For example, some bees can Orient themselves based on the position of the sun, or they can Orient themselves based on geographical features. Similarly, for bees, scent trails are just one way of communicating, not the only way.",

At the year-end board meeting of Z Tobacco Company, Director A argued that the above statistics showed that the tobacco industry's revenue on advertising was exactly equal to its expenditure, and therefore such advertising could be avoided at all. Director B was of the opinion that since the above 10% of smokers switched to brands that hardly included the Company's brand, the Company's advertising expenditure was actually a loss.",

    "D": "There are substances that do not conduct heat as well, but whose molecules have a similar structure",
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "First step: Find the argument argument: A large number of atoms in a molecule is an essential argument that makes the substance have strong thermal conductivity: X molecule has a Y structure, which connects a large number of atoms, and a substance composed of this molecule has strong thermal conductivity among other substances of the same type. The explanation of the question is as follows: Two phenomena of molecules are found: one is that there are a large number of atoms; the other is that substances composed of molecules can conduct heat. The conclusion connects these two points and deduces the cause-and-effect relationship. The strongest way to make a dent is to have something that conducts heat, but doesn't have a lot of atoms. A: Substances with a large number of atoms of other structures have strong thermal conductivity, indicating that a large number of atoms have good thermal conductivity regardless of the structure, which supports the argument. Option B: indicates that there are a large number of atoms but the thermal conductivity is not strong, the topic stem says that there are atoms have strong thermal conductivity, through the way of comparison, to explain whether there is no necessary connection between atoms and thermal conductivity is strong, is to weaken the argument; C) Strong thermal conductivity but no Y structure, the discussion is about the relationship between thermal conductivity and Y structure, the discussion is about the relationship between thermal conductivity and atoms, so it can not be weakened, eliminated; D) The relationship between thermal conductivity and structure, and the relationship between thermal conductivity and atoms.

Argument: In order to improve the competitive level of athletes in sports competitions, they should strengthen their training at high altitudes. Argument: ① For the same person, the higher the heart rate, the more blood goes into circulation per unit time, the red blood cells in the blood carry oxygen, the more oxygen a person gets through the blood circulation per unit time, the better his physical ability and performance. ② At high altitudes, the number of red blood cells per unit volume of blood in the body is higher than at low altitudes. Step 3: Identify the options. Item A: Add to the evidence. A) To support an argument. If altitude has an effect on heart rate, it is not clear whether it is positive or negative. The conclusion is still valid. (B) Make a connection. The heart rate at high altitude is not lower than that at low altitude, thus improving the level of competition and enhancing the effect of higher altitude with more red blood cells. By using negative substitution, if the athletes' heart rate at high altitude is lower than that at low altitude, though the number of red blood cells in the blood will increase at high altitude, the heart rate will slow down, which will lead to the inability to obtain more oxygen through more blood circulation, which has a negative effect on physical performance, and there is no need to train at high altitude, which negates the argument. Therefore, it must be assumed. C) What do you think of it? The athlete's heart rate is slower than that of the average person. It is not certain whether he can improve his performance at high altitude. D) to add to the argument. D) The increased heart rate of athletes trained at high altitudes further supports the argument.

Otherwise, the reverse is true. The incidence in the first group was lower than in the second group, which in turn was lower than in the third. But check I also states that the proportion of people over 60 years old in the first group is lower than in the second group, which is lower than in the third group. Therefore, it is very likely that the phenomenon described in the question is not caused by the amount or presence of blood donations, but by differences in age or distribution. Check item Ⅱ indicates that blood donors have a good constitution before they donate blood. Therefore, good constitution is not caused by blood donation. It is formed long before blood donation. Therefore, compared with the first, two groups and the third group, the first two groups of objects have blood donation records, at least that they have a good physique before the first blood donation, and the third group of objects has never donated blood, their physique is not known, some of them poor physique is difficult to be screened by the way of blood donation physical examination, So the higher incidence of cancer and heart disease in the third group is quite natural, not caused by blood donation.

If it infuses too many eggs in the host's eggs, its larvae die in competition with each other for lack of space and nourishment; If it infuses too few eggs, the excess nutrients in the host egg will rot, which in turn causes the larvae to die.",

Otherwise, if the wasp's parasitic reproduction mechanism does not include its ability to accurately distinguish the size of the host's eggs, it would not be able to inject just the right number of its own eggs into the eggs of various insects of different sizes suitable for its offspring. ②Ⅱ is not necessarily true, because it is entirely possible that insects with larger eggs are much less numerous than those with smaller eggs, and thus the wasps would be relatively concentrated in the insect aggregation areas with smaller eggs. ③Ⅲ is obviously not necessarily true.

A, regular chocolate consumption regulates blood sugar levels in patients with hypoglycemia, does not indicate a relationship between chocolate consumption and a reduced risk of stroke, does not strengthen the argument; B) The study was conducted on men and the findings were universal, so the researchers' similar findings in women are consistent with the above findings and support the argument that regular chocolate consumption reduces stroke risk. C) The association between chocolate consumption and a lower risk of stroke is strengthened by the fact that chocolate contains flavonoids, which may protect against stroke. D) the fact that some of the men who had had strokes regularly consumed chocolate weakened the argument. But C was strengthened by the chocolate itself, so B was weaker than C.",

We can make the following hypothesis: If there is only one sick dog, the owner of the sick dog will find that other dogs are normal, deduce that his dog is the sick dog, and will kill his dog on the first day. On the other hand, it means that everyone can see other people's sick dogs, and there is more than one sick dog in the village. The absence of gunfire on the first day means there is more than one sick dog in the village. If there are two sick dogs in the village, the owner of the sick dog will find out that someone else has a sick dog and will not shoot his dog on the first day. When he finds that the owner of the other sick dog did not kill his dog on the first day, he assumes that the other person also saw a sick dog, and they will both shoot their dog the next day. There were no gunshots the next day, suggesting that there were more than two sick dogs in the village. If there are three sick dogs in the village, the owner of the sick dog will find out that other people have two sick dogs and will not shoot his dog for the first two days. When the owner of the other two sick dogs did not shoot his own dogs for the previous two days, he assumed that the other person had also seen the two sick dogs, and the three men shot their own dogs on the third day. By analogy, if there are Ⅲ sick dogs in the village, the owner of the sick dog will see ⅲ-1 sick dog, when it found that no one killed his dog before ⅲ-1 days, then it can infer that his dog is sick dog, so as to kill his dog on the first day.

    "explanation": "A person's intake of cholesterol and fat is unconditionally proportional to his serum cholesterol index. Then, if the per capita intake of cholesterol and fat in China is 1/2 of that in Europe, the per capita serum cholesterol index is also equal to 1/2 of that in Europe. However, it is concluded that the limit is 1/4 of the average cholesterol and fat intake in Europe, and within this limit, the above two become 1/2 of that in Europe, but the average serum cholesterol index in China is not necessarily equal to 1/2 of that in Europe. Therefore, it can be concluded that the per capita intake of cholesterol and fat in China",

Statistics show that from the 1950s to the present, the accident rate of civilian flights has been declining, with deaths per billion passenger kilometers, 78 in 1945, 0.90 in 1950, and 0.013 in the last 30 years. However, the absolute number of civil aviation accidents has increased in recent decades, “he said",

    "A": "Information technology is changing so fast that if a civil aviation accident happens in one place now, the news goes around the world very quickly.",
    "B": "In terms of civil aviation safety, the accident rate is lowest in the European Union and highest in Africa",

    "D": "In recent decades, the earth's climate has changed abnormally, and severe weather such as heavy fog has increased",
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "explanation: The explanation is that the air accident rate and the death rate are decreasing, but the absolute number of civil aviation accidents is increasing. The rate of air accidents = the number of air accidents/the total amount of civil aviation transport. Therefore, the best explanation for this question is that the total amount of civil aviation transport is increasing greatly. If the total volume of air traffic is increasing, the accident rate can go down even if the number of accidents is increasing.",
